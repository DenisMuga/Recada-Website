                  <p>Grace has been passionate about 
                      children ministry. For 18 years Grace worked with Compassion International Kenya an organization 
                      working with children in many parts of Kenya. Grace resigned later in 2012 and has since started 
                      a school in Mathare area 4B. 
                      The project is targeting Highly Vulnerable Children (HVC) who are not attending school (due to 
                      various reasons) within Mathare slums and Sondu rural.</p>

                      <p>Believers Fellowship Entrepreneurship Development (BFED) project was started in 2007, with the 
                          first group consisting of five church members (four ladies and a young man) from our local church, 
                          OCC-Believers Fellowship Tabernacle (Lucky Summer). This number has since grown to fifty members. 
                          After the experience gained from working with the Lucky-summer as a pilot group and local church 
                          members who are staying in Mathare slum as a special group; Rev. Gabriel and Grace have since moved 
                          on to launch the Bondo/Rarieda agricultural and horticultural group. The new group is modeled in a 
                          rural set up.The direct beneficiaries of this project are needy community members both men and women. 
                          The emphasis is on the younger generations who are more vulnerable, and easily get involved in diverse 
                          negative activities when not engaged. </p>

                          As an organization, we have carried out a preliminary survey and realized the need to extend 
                          the entrepreneurship program to the rural areas. Indeed, there are many families living in 
                          poverty, therefore, we have decided to make a difference even in a little way.  The group 
                          consists of 10 members of 5 people per cell. The small grant given to the individuals is 
                          intended to be used in the development of income generating small scale business enterprise, 
                          agriculture and horticulture for the communities living along the shores of Lake Victoria.</p>
